## 1. Brand Architecture

Three entities. Three voices. One person. Here's how they stay clean.

```
Late Bloomer Studio LLC (parent)
  |
  |--- Huge Tool LLC (DBA) ---- tool.nyc
  |                              Consulting: brand + web
  |                              Voice: expert, direct, opinionated
  |                              Audience: business owners
  |                              Platforms: LinkedIn, Instagram, tool.nyc
  |
  |--- Club Stack (Product) ---- clubstack.com (future)
  |                              SaaS: ticketing + sites for venues
  |                              Voice: professional, product-focused
  |                              Audience: venue owners/operators
  |                              Platforms: own site, direct outreach
  |
  |--- Club Stack (Culture) ---- @club.stack (Instagram + Substack)
                                 Party promotion, scene commentary
                                 Voice: warm, communal, music-nerd
                                 Audience: DJs, dancers, scenesters
                                 Platforms: Instagram, Substack
```

### The Rules

| | Huge Tool | Club Stack Product | Club Stack Culture |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sells** | Consulting packages | SaaS subscriptions | Nothing (trust) |
| **Talks about** | Design, code, business | Venue operations, ticketing | Music, parties, community |
| **Links to** | tool.nyc | clubstack.com | Substack, event pages |
| **Cross-pollinates** | Can mention Club Stack as a "thing I'm building" | Can reference Huge Tool as the builder | Never sells the product directly |
| **Tone** | "Here's how this works" | "Here's what this saves you" | "This weekend was special" |

### Where They Touch

- **Huge Tool feeds Club Stack Product**: consulting work funds development time. Consulting clients see you build real products, which builds credibility.
- **Club Stack Culture feeds Club Stack Product**: venue owners follow @club.stack because they care about the scene. When the product launches, they already trust you. But the culture account never becomes a sales funnel. The product sells itself through direct outreach and word-of-mouth from the culture side.
- **Club Stack Culture feeds Huge Tool**: being embedded in nightlife culture in NYC gives you stories, opinions, and a lived perspective that makes your consulting content more interesting than the average "hire me" freelancer.

### The One Thing to Never Do

Don't turn @club.stack into a product pitch account. The moment it smells like marketing, the 11K followers lose trust. If someone asks about the product in DMs, send them to the product site. The culture account's job is to stay real.

---

## 2. Pricing Restructure

You're at $300-400/day and $5K websites. The NYC market for a senior solo doing brand + web is $15K-$30K. You're leaving $10K-$25K on the table per project. That stops now.

### Productized Packages

Present these as named tiers, not hourly rates. Clients buy outcomes, not time.

#### Brand Packages

| Package | What's Included | Price | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brand Sprint** | Logo, color system, type system, basic brand guidelines (PDF). 2 rounds of revision. | $6,000 | 2 weeks |
| **Full Identity** | Everything in Sprint + brand strategy doc, voice/tone guide, social templates, business card/letterhead, signage specs. 3 rounds of revision. | $12,000 | 4 weeks |
| **Brand + Collateral** | Everything in Full Identity + packaging, menu design, environmental graphics, merch templates. | $18,000 | 6 weeks |

#### Web Packages

| Package | What's Included | Price | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Starter Site** | 3-5 page site on open-source stack (Astro/similar). Mobile-first. Contact form. Basic SEO. Content loading assistance. | $8,000 | 3 weeks |
| **Business Site** | 5-10 pages. CMS for client self-editing. Blog/news section. Analytics. 1 month post-launch support. | $14,000 | 5 weeks |
| **Full Platform** | Custom functionality (e-commerce, booking, client portal, integrations). Everything in Business + custom features scoped per project. | $20,000-$30,000 | 6-10 weeks |

#### Combined Packages (This Is Your Sweet Spot)

| Package | What's Included | Price | Savings vs. Separate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Launch Kit** | Brand Sprint + Starter Site | $12,000 | Save $2K |
| **Growth Package** | Full Identity + Business Site | $22,000 | Save $4K |
| **The Full Build** | Brand + Collateral + Full Platform | $38,000-$45,000 | Save $3K-$5K |

#### Monthly Retainers

| Tier | What's Included | Price |
|---|---|---|
| **Maintenance** | Hosting, updates, security patches, 2 hrs/month of content changes | $500/mo |
| **Growth** | Everything in Maintenance + 8 hrs/month design/dev work, monthly analytics review | $3,000/mo |
| **Embedded** | Dedicated 2 days/week, strategic partner, priority access | $5,000/mo |

### How to Present Pricing

1. **Never quote hourly.** If someone asks your rate, say "I price by project. Let me understand what you need first."
2. **Anchor high.** Show the Growth Package first, then the Launch Kit feels like a deal.
3. **Name the savings.** "Doing brand and web together saves you $4K and 3 weeks because I'm not handing off between designers and developers."
4. **Use the differentiator.** "You'll own everything. Open-source stack, your hosting, your data. No vendor lock-in. If we part ways, you keep it all and anyone can maintain it."
5. **The "embarrassed by your website" line.** Use it. It's honest and it lands. "Most of my clients come to me because they're embarrassed to send people to their website. I fix that."

### Transition Plan

- Don't raise prices on existing clients mid-project.
- New inquiries starting now get the new pricing.
- If you're nervous, start the combined packages at $10K (Launch Kit) and $18K (Growth Package) for your first 2-3 clients at new pricing. You're still 2-3x your old rates and below market.
- After 3 projects at new pricing, hold the line. You'll have case studies to justify it.

## 3. Content Strategy — Huge Tool

### Platform Roles

- **LinkedIn**: where the money is. Business owners, founders, operators. Written posts, opinions, process breakdowns. This is your top-of-funnel.
- **Instagram**: where the personality is. Face-to-camera, behind-the-scenes, "watch me think out loud." This is your trust-builder.

### Content Pillars

Four themes. Every post fits one.

| Pillar | What It Covers | Why It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Own Your Stack** | Open source, anti-lock-in, why Squarespace/Wix are traps, data ownership, security basics | Opinionated + educational. Positions you as the person who cares about the client's long-term health. |
| **2. Design That Works** | Brand decisions, typography choices, color theory applied to real businesses, "why this logo works/doesn't" | Shows taste + expertise. Business owners recognize bad design but can't articulate why. You do it for them. |
| **3. Building in Public** | What you're working on (tool.nyc, Club Stack), technical decisions, what you learned this week, mistakes | Humanizing. People hire people they feel they know. This is the @ohneis energy — genuine teaching from the workbench. |
| **4. Small Business Real Talk** | Pricing, working with freelancers, what to ask before hiring a designer/dev, red flags | Trust-building. Giving away the playbook makes people want to hire you more, not less. |

### Posting Cadence

- **LinkedIn**: 3 posts/week (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- **Instagram**: 2 posts/week (Tue, Thu) — 1 Reel + 1 carousel or static

This fits inside 2.5 hours/week. See Section 5 for the exact schedule.

### LinkedIn Approach

**Format**: Text posts, 150-300 words. No images needed (LinkedIn algo favors text-only). Occasional carousel for process breakdowns.

**Structure** (for every post):
1. Hook (first line visible before "see more") — make it a strong opinion or surprising statement
2. Context (2-3 sentences)
3. The insight or lesson (the meat)
4. One clear takeaway
5. Soft CTA or question (never "hire me" — instead "what's your experience with X?")

**Voice**: Direct, opinionated, zero jargon. Write like you talk. Short sentences. Line breaks between ideas. You're not writing an essay — you're making a point.

**What NOT to do on LinkedIn**:
- Don't use hashtags (they look desperate and the algo doesn't reward them anymore)
- Don't post motivational content
- Don't write in the "I woke up at 5am and realized..." format
- Don't post about AI unless you have a genuinely novel take

### Instagram Approach

**Format**: Reels (30-90 sec face-to-camera) and carousels (4-7 slides).

**Reel style**: Same energy as your music production content. Fast, low-budget, phone camera. Start mid-thought. No intros. "So here's something that'll save you $200/month on your website..." — cut.

**Carousel style**: Bold text on solid backgrounds (use your CMYK palette). One idea per slide. Last slide = soft CTA or follow prompt.

**Voice**: Slightly more casual than LinkedIn. You're explaining something to a friend at a bar.

**Reference (@ohneis style)**: Strong visual hook in first 2 seconds. Teaching something specific, not just talking at the camera. Show the screen when relevant. End with a clear takeaway, not a pitch.

### 4 Weeks of Starter Content

#### Week 1: Establish the Voice

| Day | Platform | Pillar | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | LinkedIn | Own Your Stack | "Your Squarespace site costs you more than you think. Here's what happens when you try to leave." — Break down the hidden switching costs of closed platforms. |
| Tue | Instagram Reel | Building in Public | Face-to-camera: "I'm rebuilding my consulting site from scratch. Here's why I'm using the same tools I build client sites with." Show the Astro/Supabase setup briefly. 45 sec. |
| Wed | LinkedIn | Small Biz Real Talk | "What to actually look for when hiring someone to build your website. It's not their portfolio." — Talk about communication speed, whether they explain things, whether you'll own the code. |
| Thu | Instagram Carousel | Design That Works | "3 signs your brand is costing you clients" — slide 1: hook. slides 2-4: the signs (inconsistent colors, stock photos everywhere, no clear personality). slide 5: "This is fixable." |
| Fri | LinkedIn | Design That Works | "I redesigned a restaurant's menu and their average check went up 15%. Typography isn't decoration. It's a business decision." (Use a real example or hypothetical composite.) |

#### Week 2: Build Authority

| Day | Platform | Pillar | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | LinkedIn | Own Your Stack | "Your web developer shouldn't be your landlord. If you can't export your data, move your site, or change one thing without calling them — you don't own your website." |
| Tue | Instagram Reel | Own Your Stack | Quick screen recording: "Here's how to check if your website platform actually lets you leave." Walk through the export process (or lack thereof) on Squarespace/Wix. 60 sec. |
| Wed | LinkedIn | Building in Public | "I'm building a SaaS product for nightclubs. Here's what I learned this week about venue operations that I never would've guessed." (Something specific from Club Stack research.) |
| Thu | Instagram Carousel | Small Biz Real Talk | "What a $5K website actually includes vs. a $15K one" — break it down honestly. Not to justify your pricing, but to educate. |
| Fri | LinkedIn | Small Biz Real Talk | "The best investment a small business can make isn't ads. It's a website that doesn't make you cringe when you share the link." |

#### Week 3: Show the Work

| Day | Platform | Pillar | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | LinkedIn | Design That Works | Pick a well-known NYC local business with a bad website. Don't name them, but describe the category. "I walked into one of the best [bakeries/barbershops/studios] in Brooklyn last week. Their product is a 10. Their website is a 3. Here's what 2 weeks and $12K would fix." |
| Tue | Instagram Reel | Building in Public | "Okay here's something I just figured out while building tool.nyc" — share a specific design or code decision. Keep it visual. Show before/after. 45 sec. |
| Wed | LinkedIn | Own Your Stack | "Open source isn't just for engineers. Here's why your small business should care." — Translate FOSS values into business-owner language: no license fees, no vendor lock-in, community of maintainers, you actually own it. |
| Thu | Instagram Carousel | Design That Works | "The brand color test: does your business pass?" — teach people to evaluate their own brand palette. 5 slides with real examples (anonymized or public domain). |
| Fri | LinkedIn | Building in Public | "Week 3 of rebuilding my site. The hardest part isn't the code — it's deciding what to cut." — Share the editing process. What you decided NOT to include and why. |

#### Week 4: Convert

| Day | Platform | Pillar | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | LinkedIn | Small Biz Real Talk | "I used to charge $5K for a website. Now I charge $14K. Here's what changed (hint: not the deliverables)." — Talk about pricing confidence, value communication, and why underpricing hurts the client too (less investment = less commitment). |
| Tue | Instagram Reel | Design That Works | "The one font change that makes every small business site look more expensive." — Pick a before/after with system fonts vs. a well-chosen type pairing. Quick, visual, satisfying. 30 sec. |
| Wed | LinkedIn | Own Your Stack | "I built my client a website they can update themselves without calling me. They think I'm a magician. It's just a CMS." — Demystify the tech. Position yourself as the person who doesn't create dependency. |
| Thu | Instagram Carousel | Building in Public | "Month 1 recap: what I've posted, what worked, what I'm doing differently." — Meta content. Shows you're paying attention to what resonates. People love transparency about the process. |
| Fri | LinkedIn | Design That Works | Share a specific, real case study. Before/after. Business impact if you have it. "Here's what $12K of brand and web work looks like for a [type of business]." First post that links directly to tool.nyc. |

### Batching & Production

- **Write all 3 LinkedIn posts on Sunday** (45 min). They're just text. Draft them in a notes app, schedule them using LinkedIn's native scheduler.
- **Record both Instagram videos/create carousel on one day** (shoot day is Saturday or Sunday, whatever works). One sitting, two pieces of content. Carousels are made in Figma or Canva — don't overthink it.
- **Never produce day-of.** The whole point of batching is that when Wednesday hits, you just post what's already done.

## 4. Content Strategy — Club Stack Cultural

### What @club.stack Is

A cultural account. It exists because you care about dance music and nightlife in NYC. It's a community node, not a marketing funnel.

### How It Feeds the Product (Without Becoming a Sales Channel)

The connection is indirect and that's what makes it work:

1. **You build trust with venue owners** by showing you understand and care about the culture. When Club Stack the product launches, these people already know you and respect you.
2. **You build a mailing list** via Substack. When the product is ready, you can mention it once in a newsletter as "something I've been building." Not a pitch — an update.
3. **You stay embedded in the scene** which gives you product insight. Every party you throw, every conversation with a booker, every complaint about ticket platforms — that's product research.

### Recommended Cadence

- **Instagram**: 3-5 posts/week (this is what you're already doing — don't change the volume)
- **Stories**: Daily when you're at events, otherwise skip it
- **Substack**: 2x/month. One event recap or scene commentary, one longer essay or interview.

### How to Keep It Authentic

- If you catch yourself thinking "this would be good for the product," stop. Post it if it's good for the community. Skip it if it's only good for marketing.
- Never announce the product on this account. When it launches, let venue owners discover it organically or hear about it through DMs/word-of-mouth.
- The only acceptable cross-reference: if someone asks "who built this?" about a venue's Club Stack-powered site, you can answer. Don't volunteer it.

### Time Budget

This doesn't come out of your 2.5 hrs/week content budget. This is stuff you're already doing because you enjoy it. Keep it that way. If it starts feeling like work, you're doing it wrong.

---

## 5. Weekly Schedule

All times are approximate. The goal is 30 min/day, 5 days/week = 2.5 hrs.

| Day | Time | Task | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sunday** | 45 min | Write all 3 LinkedIn posts for the week. Schedule them (Mon/Wed/Fri). | 3 LinkedIn posts queued |
| **Monday** | 15 min | Review Monday's LinkedIn post (already scheduled). Respond to any comments from last week. | Engagement |
| **Tuesday** | 30 min | Record Instagram Reel. Quick edit (CapCut/in-app). Post. | 1 Reel posted |
| **Wednesday** | 15 min | Review Wednesday's LinkedIn post. Reply to comments. Check DMs. | Engagement |
| **Thursday** | 30 min | Create Instagram carousel in Figma/Canva. Post. | 1 carousel posted |
| **Friday** | 15 min | Review Friday's LinkedIn post. Reply to comments. Note what performed well this week. | Engagement + weekly reflection |

**Total: ~2.5 hours/week**

### Overflow / Optional

- If you have an extra 15 min on Saturday: batch-record 2-3 Reels to bank for future weeks.
- If a post does well (>2x your usual engagement): make a follow-up the next week. Ride the wave.
- If something happens in real-time that's relevant (a Squarespace outage, a notable bad redesign, etc.): post it live. Skip the queue. Timely content wins.

## 6. Revenue Path

### Phase 1: Getting to $5K/Month Stable

**Timeline**: 0-3 months

**The Math**:
- 1 Launch Kit ($12K) every 2 months = $6K/month average
- OR 1 Growth retainer ($3K/mo) + occasional small projects
- OR 2 Starter Sites ($8K each) per quarter = $5.3K/month

**What Needs to Happen**:

1. **Raise prices immediately.** New inquiries get new rates starting this week. No grandfathering new clients at old rates.
2. **Close 1 project at new pricing.** This is the hardest one. After the first client pays $12K, your brain accepts the new floor.
3. **Tool.nyc goes live with a portfolio and booking CTA.** Doesn't need to be perfect. Needs to exist. (See Section 8.)
4. **Start posting content.** Not to go viral — to have something to point to when people Google you or check your LinkedIn. Content is a trust layer, not a lead gen machine (yet).
5. **Tell 10 people you've relaunched.** Not a mass email. 10 individual messages to people who've referred you before or who know business owners. "Hey, I've restructured my consulting practice. If you know anyone who needs brand or web work, I'd appreciate the intro."

**Revenue Split at $5K/month**: 100% consulting. Club Stack isn't generating revenue yet.

### Phase 2: Getting to $12K/Month Stable

**Timeline**: 4-12 months

**The Math — Option A (Consulting Heavy)**:
- 2 active projects/month averaging $10K each = $10K/month from consulting (this is 2 Launch Kits or 1 Growth Package)
- 2 maintenance retainers at $500/mo = $1K/month
- 1 Growth retainer at $3K/mo = $3K/month (if you land one)
- **Total: $12-14K/month**

**The Math — Option B (Consulting + Early SaaS)**:
- 1 active project/month at $12K average = $6K/month consulting (normalized over gaps)
- 1 retainer at $3K/mo
- Club Stack MVP live with 10 venues at $299/mo = $3K/month
- **Total: $12K/month**

**What Needs to Happen**:

1. **Content engine is running.** By month 4, you have 48+ LinkedIn posts and 24+ Instagram posts. Some of them have done well. Inbound inquiries start to trickle.
2. **3-4 case studies on tool.nyc.** Real projects, real results. These close deals.
3. **Club Stack MVP is live** (see Section 7). Even if it's just 5 venues, it's revenue and it's a proof point.
4. **Retainer pipeline.** Every project client gets offered a maintenance retainer at project close. Conversion target: 50% of project clients become retainer clients.
5. **Raise prices again.** After 4-6 projects at the new rates, bump Launch Kit to $14K, Growth Package to $25K. You now have the case studies to justify it.

### Where Consulting and SaaS Intersect

- **Shared tech stack**: every tool.nyc client site you build is practice and refinement for Club Stack. Every Club Stack feature you build makes you faster at consulting.
- **Shared credibility**: "I also build a SaaS platform used by NYC venues" is a powerful line in a consulting pitch. It signals you're not just a freelancer — you build products.
- **Shared audience (eventually)**: venue owners who use Club Stack may need broader brand work. Consulting clients in nightlife/hospitality may want to know about Club Stack.
- **Time protection**: the retainer model buys you predictable income so you can dedicate focused time to Club Stack development without feast/famine stress.

## 7. Club Stack Product Roadmap

### MVP (Months 1-4 of Active Development)

**What it does**: A venue gets a simple, fast website with integrated ticketing. Customers buy tickets via Stripe (connected to the venue's own Stripe account). The venue owns their customer data.

**Core features**:
- Venue profile page (name, bio, location, photos, links)
- Event listing with ticket purchasing (Stripe Connect)
- Customer email capture at purchase
- Basic event analytics (tickets sold, revenue, email list size)
- Simple admin dashboard for venue operators

**What to build first**: The ticketing flow. Everything else is secondary. If a venue can list an event and sell tickets on day one, you have an MVP.

**What to sell before you build**: The pitch is simple. Walk into a venue, ask what they pay RA/DICE per ticket. Do the math in front of them. "You sold 2,000 tickets last month at $25. DICE took $3.75 per ticket. That's $7,500. With Club Stack, you'd pay $299/month flat. You'd save $7,200." Then: "I'm onboarding 10 founding venues at $299/month. You'll get a custom site, ticketing, and your customer data. Interested?"

**You can start selling with a landing page and a demo.** The product doesn't need to be done.

**Revenue target**: 10 venues at $299/month = $2,990/month

### V2: DJ/Artist Profiles (Months 5-8)

**What it adds**:
- DJ/artist profile pages (music links, mixes, bio — no images, music-first)
- Booking request system (venues can discover and contact DJs through the platform)
- Pay transparency features (optional — DJs can list their rates or rate ranges)
- DJ can link their profile to events they're playing

**Why this matters**: This is where the network effect starts. DJs want to be on the platform because venues are there. Venues get access to a curated talent pool. Both sides benefit.

**Pricing**: Free for DJs (they're the supply side). Venues stay on their existing plan. Consider an upgraded venue tier ($499/month) that includes enhanced booking tools.

**Revenue target**: 25 venues (mix of $299 and $499 tiers) = $8,000-$10,000/month

### V3: Marketplace + Social (Months 9-14)

**What it adds**:
- Social features: following, event recommendations, shared playlists
- Promoter profiles and tools
- Venue-to-venue networking
- Advanced analytics and CRM features
- API for integrations (POS, lighting, etc.)

**Why this matters**: This is the moat. Once you have a connected ecosystem of venues, DJs, and promoters, switching costs are high. The network IS the product.

**Pricing**: Introduce a premium tier at $999-$1,499/month for large venues wanting full marketplace access, CRM, and advanced features.

**Revenue target**: 44+ venues (breakeven) moving toward 80-100 venues = $20,000-$40,000/month

### Build vs. Sell Priority

| Phase | Build | Sell |
|---|---|---|
| Now | Landing page + demo | Founding venue partnerships (in person) |
| MVP | Ticketing flow + venue site | 10 venues at $299/mo |
| V2 | DJ profiles + booking | Upgraded tiers to existing venues + DJ onboarding |
| V3 | Marketplace features | Self-serve signups, word-of-mouth growth |

**Key principle**: sell first, build second. Every feature should have a paying customer waiting for it before you write a line of code. You already have the scene access through @club.stack to have these conversations.

## 8. Portfolio & Conversion Path

### What tool.nyc Needs to Convert Visitors

Someone finds you on LinkedIn or Instagram. They click through to tool.nyc. You have 10 seconds before they decide if you're legit. Here's what needs to be there.

#### The Minimum Viable Portfolio

This is not a full redesign. This is the 20% that gets 80% of results.

1. **Hero section**: One sentence about what you do. "Brand and web for businesses that take themselves seriously." A strong visual (your best work, full-bleed). A CTA button: "Let's talk" (Cal.com link).

2. **3 case studies**: Three projects. That's it. Pick the three where the before/after is most dramatic OR the client is most recognizable. If you don't have three strong ones, do two real ones and one personal project (Club Stack counts).

3. **Services section**: The three package tiers with starting prices. Not a full pricing page — just enough to anchor expectations and filter out people who can't afford you.

4. **About section**: 3 sentences about you. Photo. The differentiator line: "I get clients off platforms they can't control and onto stacks they actually own."

5. **Footer CTA**: Sticky bottom bar (you already have this pattern from the hardsun.com reference). "Ready to stop being embarrassed by your website?" + Cal.com booking link.

That's 5 sections on one page. No blog (yet). No extensive about page. No testimonials page (put 1-2 short quotes inline near the case studies if you have them).

#### Case Study Format

Not essays. Not PDFs. Visual, fast, scroll-through.

Each case study on tool.nyc should be:

| Section | Content | Length |
|---|---|---|
| Cover | Full-bleed hero image of the final work. Client name. One line: what you did. | 1 screen |
| Problem | 2-3 sentences. What was wrong. | 3 sentences max |
| Solution | 2-3 sentences. What you did. | 3 sentences max |
| The Work | 4-8 images. Full-bleed. Minimal captions. Let the work speak. Desktop, mobile, brand collateral, before/after if applicable. | Scroll gallery |
| Impact | 1-3 metrics or a client quote. "Revenue up 15%." "Bookings doubled." "I actually send people to our website now." | 1-3 lines |
| CTA | "Want results like this? Let's talk." | 1 line + button |

Total read time per case study: under 60 seconds. That's the goal.

#### The Conversion Path

```
LinkedIn/Instagram post
  --> Profile link: tool.nyc
    --> Hero (10 sec: "do I trust this person?")
      --> Case studies (30 sec: "can they do good work?")
        --> Services/pricing (10 sec: "can I afford this?")
          --> Cal.com booking (conversion)
```

Every step should take under 60 seconds. If someone spends 2 minutes on your site and books a call, that's a win. Don't make them dig.

## 9. First 30 Days Action Plan

This assumes you start on a Monday. Adjust dates as needed.

### Week 1: Foundation

| Day | Action | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Mon | Update tool.nyc: hero section, services section with new pricing, "Let's talk" CTA linked to Cal.com. Does not need to be pretty yet. Needs to exist. | 60 min (dev time, not content time) |
| Tue | Write your first 3 LinkedIn posts (Week 1 from Section 3). Schedule them for Mon/Wed/Fri. | 45 min |

### End of Month 1 Checkpoint

By day 30, you should have:
- 12 LinkedIn posts published
- 4 Instagram Reels published
- 4 Instagram carousels published
- 1-2 case studies on tool.nyc
- New pricing live on tool.nyc
- 10+ personal outreach messages sent
- A clear sense of what content format feels natural and what gets engagement

If you haven't booked a single call yet, that's normal. Month 1 is about establishing presence. Month 2-3 is when inbound starts.

## 10. Metrics to Track

Check these once a month. Put them in a spreadsheet or notion table. Don't obsess over them weekly.

| Metric | What It Tells You | Target (Month 3) | Target (Month 6) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LinkedIn impressions/week** | Is your content reaching people? | 2,000/week | 5,000/week |
| **Inbound inquiries/month** | Is content converting to conversations? | 2/month | 5/month |
| **Proposal close rate** | Is your pricing/positioning working? | 50% | 60% |
| **Monthly recurring revenue** | Are retainers stacking? | $500 (1 retainer) | $3,500 (2-3 retainers) |
| **Monthly project revenue** | Are you closing projects at new rates? | $6K/month avg | $10K/month avg |
| **Club Stack venues signed** | Is the product gaining traction? | 0 (still building) | 5 (early adopters) |

### What These Numbers Mean

- If **impressions are high but inquiries are low**: your content is interesting but not attracting buyers. Shift toward more Small Biz Real Talk and Design That Works pillars, less Building in Public.
- If **inquiries are high but close rate is low**: your pricing presentation needs work, or you're attracting the wrong clients. Review who's reaching out and whether your qualifying process is filtering effectively.
- If **close rate is high but inquiries are low**: your work is great but not enough people know about it. Double down on content volume or add a referral incentive for past clients.
- If **project revenue is on target but MRR is zero**: you're not offering retainers at project close. Make it part of your delivery process — the last deliverable is always a retainer proposal.

## Appendix: The One-Line Reminders

Tape these to your monitor or put them in your phone's lock screen.

- **You are not charging enough.** The market says $15-30K. Believe the market.
- **Post before you're ready.** The first 20 posts will be mediocre. Post them anyway. Nobody's watching yet — that's the gift.
- **Sell before you build.** If a venue won't commit at $299/month before the product exists, they won't commit after either.
- **@club.stack is not a funnel.** The moment it smells like marketing, the trust dies. Keep it sacred.
- **One page, three case studies, one CTA.** That's all tool.nyc needs right now. Everything else is procrastination.
- **Retainers are the game.** Projects are spiky. Retainers are stable. Every client should leave with a retainer offer.
