# Voice & Style Guide

## Core Principles

1. **Direct over casual.** Directness is the goal; casual tone is a byproduct, not a target. Get to the point. Make the point relevant to the platform.
2. **Understated confidence.** State capabilities as facts. Never pitch, never oversell, never use superlatives. "I make websites" energy.
3. **Plain upfront, taste on display.** Site copy should be minimal and clear about what we do. The portfolio and store are where personality and taste come through.
4. **A person, not an agency.** The voice belongs to a person who is good at what they do. It should never read like a Big Serious Agency or a startup trying to sound important.

## Voice Characteristics

### Sentence structure
- Default to short, declarative sentences.
- Stack observations; don't over-subordinate.
- Semicolons are a natural connective — use them to link related ideas instead of conjunctions or new paragraphs.
- Parentheticals for context or asides, not for hedging.

### Tone
- Confident without posturing.
- Warm but not bubbly. No exclamation marks unless genuinely warranted (a client email greeting, at most).
- Dry wit is fine when it lands naturally. Never forced humor.
- No cussing, especially on LinkedIn. Clean but not sanitized.

### Vocabulary
- Plain language. No jargon, no marketing buzzwords, no "leveraging synergies."
- Avoid qualifying language: "I think," "perhaps," "it might be." If you're saying it, say it.
- Avoid passive voice almost entirely.
- No emotional appeals or flattery.

### Rhythm
- "Ok" as a paragraph transition — conversational gear-shift.
- Colon-driven lists inline with prose.
- Intentional repetition for emphasis when it serves rhythm.
- End on a direct, almost blunt CTA. No soft landings.

## Register by Context

| Context | Formality | Humor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Site copy (public) | Medium. Composed, clear. | Minimal. Let taste do the talking. | This is the "potential client" register — more formal end of the range. |
| Portfolio / store | Medium-low. Let the work breathe. | Can be wry in descriptions. | This is where personality shows up. |
| LinkedIn | Medium. Direct, professional. | Light if any. | Primary acquisition channel. Substance over style. |
| Instagram / reels | Low-medium. Conversational. | More room here. | Audience already knows the person or is one degree away. |
| Client emails (new) | Medium. Professional, warm. | Minimal. | Adapt to their tone over time. Start more composed. |
| Client emails (existing) | Low-medium. Mirror their energy. | Match the relationship. | Looser, more direct, less scaffolding. |
| Contracts / proposals | Medium-high. Precise. | None. | Clear on scope, fees, structure. No ambiguity. |

## Anti-Patterns

- Marketing speak: "passionate about," "cutting-edge," "full-service," "end-to-end solutions"
- Agency cosplay: don't say "we" when it's one person (unless referring to a genuine collaboration)
- Hedging: "We believe that..." "It's possible that..." — just say the thing
- Superlatives: "best-in-class," "world-class," "unparalleled"
- Filler enthusiasm: "Excited to announce!" "So thrilled to share!"
- Overexplaining: trust the reader to get it

## Analogies & Framing

- Think spatially. Physical space and architecture are natural reference points.
- Ground abstract concepts in concrete, specific details (folder structures, exact times, real places).
- Build arguments through narrative, not data dumps or case studies.
- When making a case for something, show the outcome of the thinking, not the thinking itself.

## Audience

- **Primary:** Second-degree connections. People who know the person through someone, landing via LinkedIn or Instagram.
- **Good client archetype:** Excited about their own business, responsive to suggestions, collaborative.
- **Red flag archetype:** Expects you to "earn your stripes," treats the relationship as transactional leverage.
- The copy should attract the first type and quietly repel the second.

## Reference Voices

- **Gus** (NYC brand studio) — humor, personality in a studio context
- The creative writing samples (Greenpoint, Meserole Street, 9W North) represent the most unfiltered version of the voice — present-tense, sensory, deadpan. Site copy won't go this far but should share the DNA.
